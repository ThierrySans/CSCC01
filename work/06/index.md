# Project Deliverable 2

Time to start working on the project! First things first... As we learned in class, we begin with understanding user requirements. The project is where you put your knowledge in practice. 

## Requirements

First, we are going to work on the **product backlog** and produce two deliverables: the personas and the user stories.

- **Personas:** make sure that your personas, together, represent all future users of your software system.
Next, we write user stories. Study the materials provided by the client. Contact the client(s). Explore the existing software. Then start writing! Make sure you examine each and every one of your user stories critically, with the team.

- **User stories:** make sure that your user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from all prospective users).

These two deliverables should be labelled with their version (`0` for the first one). As these requirements evolve, the version of this documents will evolve as well. 

## Presentation and Quality of Writing

You have several options of presenting all write-ups in the course.

- One option is to produce one or several PDF documents. Make sure your reports look professional. Do not forget to include a cover page and a table of contents. Think of a user who chooses to read your report in electronic format — include links where appropriate.

- Another option is to set up a website. Plain vanilla HTML is enough, provided the layout, fonts, etc. are such that it is easy to navigate and easy to read. If you choose this option, we ask you to push the content of this website (either the source code or PDF exports) in your team repository as a proof that project deliverables were published on time each time. 

- Should you have a different idea of presenting your work, please, check with the instructor first. 

Whatever format you choose, make sure the report looks professional and is very easy to read: the TAs will not have much time and you need to convince them you did an excellent job! The following will always be considered when grading your work in this course:

- Presentation: the report is well formatted, looks professional, is easy to read and to navigate. 
- Quality of writing: language, grammar, clarity, professionalism.

## Submission

Submit your **product backlog** by pushing it to your team’s GitHub repository by the due date and time. The deliverables must clearly mention their version `0`. Throughout your project, your product backlog must contain all versions of these documents.  

Additionally, update your team’s GitHub repository README file to reflect the progress on your project. 

## Coming next

There is no deliverable for this part. 

As a team, you should start planning the first two sprints of your project.
