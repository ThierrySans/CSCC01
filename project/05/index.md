# Project  Deliverable 5 (final deliverable)

Deliverable 5 is your final deliverable where the final version of your product must be delivered. 

## Project Documentation

Make sure that that you project documentation includes:

- project backlog (including the change made in the two sprints)
- sprint backlogs (including your last two sprints)
- code review activity (including those made in the last two sprints - no video required this time)
- guidelines about how to build and run the final release version of your product
- guidelines about how to run unit/integration tests and acceptance/production tests on the final release version of your product
- and of course the source code of your product

## Project Presentation

Given that we have about 30 projects in total. It is not possible to ask all of you to give a presentation in class. Instead, you are going to take a video demoing your product. This video must 3 min long (+-20 seconds). It should show the most interesting feature of your product (no slide, no code) and the soundtrack should be one of you explaining what you are doing on screen. 

To make sure that this video is of good quality, here is a good way to proceed: 

1. Take a video of you demoing your app. Do not film your physical screen with your phone. Instead, make a video by capturing your screen and your microphone directly on your computer. You can easily do that using VLC: open "File" > "open capture device", select "screen" and check "use mic"
2. Check the video quality, edit the video if necessary. Again VLC can do this with VLC. 
3. Upload this video on Youtube (either as a private or public video) and share the video URL on your Github README file.

This video will be shown to the client that will select the best projects.
