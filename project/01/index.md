# Project Deliverable 1

Welcome to your new software development team! Your first task is, of course, to get to know each other — you will be working together for the next 10 weeks.

## Getting Started

- Introduce the team: include your team’s name, a team logo, and a picture of the entire team. What are the team’s goals in this project? What are your team’s strengths?

- Introduce the team members: for each member, include a picture and a 150-word biography. A biography should describe you as a professional: think of how you would introduce yourself to a prospective employee.

- Share a meal: include a picture of all team members sharing a meal. You can have lunch, dinner, coffee-and-pastries, whatever, together — it’s your choice.

- Discuss every aspect of [the team agreement](src/team-agreement.pdf) and submit all your decisions.

## Presentation and Quality of Writing

You have several options of presenting all write-ups in the course.

- One option is to produce one or several PDF documents. Make sure your reports look professional. Do not forget to include a cover page and a table of contents. Think of a user who chooses to read your report in electronic format — include links where appropriate.

- Another option is to set up a website. Plain vanilla HTML is enough, provided the layout, fonts, etc. are such that it is easy to navigate and easy to read. If you choose this option, we ask you to push the content of this website (either the source code or PDF exports) in your team repository as a proof that project deliverables were published on time each time. 

- Should you have a different idea of presenting your work, please, check with the instructor first. 

Whatever format you choose, make sure the report looks professional and is very easy to read: the TAs will not have much time and you need to convince them you did an excellent job! The following will always be considered when grading your work in this course:

- Presentation: the report is well formatted, looks professional, is easy to read and to navigate. 
- Quality of writing: language, grammar, clarity, professionalism.

## Submission

Submit your report by pushing it to your team’s GitHub repository by the due date and time.

## Coming next

There is no deliverable for this part. As a team, you should start discussing the project requirements by sharing your understanding of what the client needs.
